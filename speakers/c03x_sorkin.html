	<h2>Movie reviews</h2>
	
	<ul>"Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of<br>
	the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Even that would not have been so bad but<br>
	the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing."</ul>
	
	<ul>"I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw their<br>
	families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion."<br></ul>
